First time ever I created something in html/css 
The code probably looks like shit but I'm so fkn proud lol 
Most important lessons I figured out: 
-that little . before the / in the src that makes an image work  
-beginning to understand nesting 
Still completely lost when it comes to 
-what position is and what it does 
-what display is and what it does
